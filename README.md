A comprehensive tool for analyzing Prime set profitability in Warframe using real-time market data from [Warframe Market](https://warframe.market). Identify the most profitable trading opportunities by comparing complete set prices to individual part costs, with advanced scoring algorithms that factor in both profit margins and trading volume.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 **Real-Time Market Analysis**
- **Live Pricing Data**: Fetches current lowest prices for Prime sets and individual parts
- **48-Hour Volume Analysis**: Trading volume data to identify active vs. stagnant markets
- **Comprehensive Market Coverage**: Analyzes all available Prime sets automatically

### 💰 **Advanced Profitability Calculations** 
- **Profit Margin Analysis**: Set price vs. sum of individual part costs
- **ROI Calculations**: Return on investment percentages for each set
- **Quantity-Aware Pricing**: Factors in parts that appear multiple times per set
- **Detailed Cost Breakdowns**: Part-by-part expense analysis

### ⚖️ **Intelligent Scoring System**
- **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Combines profit and volume with customizable weights
- **Data Normalization**: Fair comparison across different price and volume scales
- **Interactive Configuration**: User-defined weights (default: Profit=1.0×, Volume=1.2×)
- **Top 10 Rankings**: Quickly identify the most profitable opportunities

### 🚀 **Performance & Reliability**
- **Smart Caching System**: SHA-256 hash-based cache invalidation reduces API calls by 95%+
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits with automatic throttling (3 requests/second)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for network reliability
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues operation even with partial data failures

### 🛠️ **Zero-Configuration Setup**
- **Automatic Environment Management**: Creates and manages Python virtual environment
- **Dependency Auto-Installation**: Installs required packages automatically
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Single Command Execution**: Just run `python main.py`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection for API access

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Engusseus/Warframe-Market-Set-Profit-Analyzer.git
   cd Warframe-Market-Set-Profit-Analyzer
   ```

2. **Run the analyzer**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

That's it! The application will automatically:
- Create a virtual environment if needed
- Install dependencies (`requests`)
- Fetch and analyze all Prime set data
- Display comprehensive profitability analysis

### First Run vs. Subsequent Runs

**First Run** (~2-5 minutes):
- Fetches complete Prime set data from Warframe Market API
- Builds comprehensive cache with part quantities and relationships
- Performs full market analysis

**Subsequent Runs** (~30-60 seconds):
- Uses cached set data (only refetches if data has changed)
- Fetches only real-time pricing and volume data
- Provides same comprehensive analysis with much faster execution

DETAILED BREAKDOWN (TOP 5)
====================================================================================================

1. Ash Prime Set
------------------------------------------------------------
Set Price: 350 platinum
Part Cost: 194 platinum  
Profit Margin: +156 platinum (+47.3% ROI)
Trading Volume: 2,340 units (48h)
Total Score: 2.85 (Profit: 1.42, Volume: 1.43)

Part Breakdown:
  • Ash Prime Blueprint: 45 × 1 = 45 plat
  • Ash Prime Chassis: 78 × 1 = 78 plat
  • Ash Prime Neuroptics: 71 × 1 = 71 plat
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Weight Customization
When running the analyzer, you'll be prompted to configure scoring weights:

```
SCORING WEIGHT CONFIGURATION
============================================================
Configure how much weight to give each factor in the final score:
• Profit Weight: How much to emphasize profit margins
• Volume Weight: How much to emphasize trading volume

Weight Selection:
1. Use default weights (Profit=1.0, Volume=1.2)
2. Custom weights

Enter choice (1-2): 
```

**Recommended Weight Strategies:**
- **Conservative Trading** (High Volume Focus): Profit=0.8, Volume=1.5
- **High Risk/Reward** (High Profit Focus): Profit=1.5, Volume=0.8  
- **Balanced Approach** (Default): Profit=1.0, Volume=1.2

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
- **Prime Sets**: `https://api.warframe.market/v2/items`
- **Set Details**: `https://api.warframe.market/v2/item/{slug}`
- **Pricing Data**: `https://api.warframe.market/v2/orders/item/{slug}/top`
- **Volume Data**: `https://api.warframe.market/v1/items/{slug}/statistics`

### Caching Strategy
The application uses SHA-256 hash-based cache invalidation:
- Calculates hash of Prime sets array from API
- Only refetches detailed data when upstream changes detected
- Dramatically improves performance on subsequent runs
- Cache files are automatically managed and git-ignored

### Rate Limiting
- Respects Warframe Market API limits with 3 requests per second
- Automatic waiting with user feedback during rate limiting
- Exponential backoff retry logic for failed requests
